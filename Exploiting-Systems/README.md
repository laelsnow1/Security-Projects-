# Exploiting Systems: Heartbleed (OpenSSL 1.0.1f)

## Overview
In this project, I simulated and exploited the Heartbleed vulnerability using a vulnerable OpenSSL server running inside Docker. The goal was to understand how a real-world SSL/TLS vulnerability can leak sensitive memory contents such as private keys, usernames, passwords, and session tokens.
This project was completed in an Ubuntu 22.04 environment and used the Heartleech exploit tool to extract data from a vulnerable OpenSSL 1.0.1f server.

## Tools Used
- Ubuntu 22.04 VM (Microsoft Azure)
- Docker
- Vulnerable OpenSSL server 
- Heartleech exploit code
- OpenSSL CLI tools
---
## Requirements 
- Deploy a vulnerable OpenSSL 1.0.1f server using Docker
- Confirm the server was accessible on port `8443`
- Clone and run the Heartleech exploit tool
- Extract leaked memory into a file 
- Use OpenSSL commands to view the extracted key output
- Stop and remove the vulnerable server when finished
---
## What I Did 
### 1. Deployed a vulnerable OpenSSL server
- Installed Docker on Ubuntu 22.04
- Pulled the vulnerable OpenSSL lab container
- Ran the container and exposed port `8443`

### 2. Installed and ran the Heartleech exploit
- Cloned the Heartleech exploit repository
- Installed required dependencies
- Ran Heartleech against the vulnerable server:
  - Output was saved into `cracked.key`

### 3. Extracted and reviewed leaked data
- Used OpenSSL to convert and view the extracted key material:
  - Output was saved into `cracked.txt`
- Confirmed that sensitive memory content could be retrieved from the server

### 4. Cleaned up the vulnerable environment
- Stopped the Docker container
- Removed the container after exploitation

## What I Learned
- Heartbleed was dangerous because it leaked server memory without authentication
- A vulnerability rated "medium" can still cause massive real-world impact
- SSL/TLS vulnerabilities are especially critical because they affect trust, encryption, and credentials
- Patching alone is not enough — organizations also had to rotate certificates, reset passwords, and assume data exposure

---
Heartbleed showed how one widely-used cryptographic library bug could compromise millions of systems. It impacted the foundation of secure web communication (SSL/TLS), which is why it became one of the most well-known vulnerabilities in cybersecurity history.

## Next Improvements
- Run a packet capture (Wireshark/tcpdump) to observe traffic
- Compare patched vs unpatched OpenSSL behavior
- Document mitigation steps
