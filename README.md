# Security Projects Portfolio

Hi, I’m Lael Snow a Computer Science student focused on cybersecurity and cloud security.

This repository contains hands-on security projects I completed using Microsoft Azure virtual machines. Each folder includes my own write-up, what I learned, and screenshots of completion.
